### Hi there! <!--ðŸ‘‹--> It's Jakub Pawlina.

I'm a young programmer from Poland. I love algorithmics and competitive programming. I take part in individual and team contests. Besides, I am keen on web development - full stack. I always gain new skills and develop my knowledge ðŸ“–

I'm also a man of many hobbies, who don't have time to be at loose end.
